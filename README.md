## My Journey Through Web Development

Hello! I'm a self-taught web developer with a passion for solving puzzles and tackling challenging problems. This passion naturally led me to the world of programming and coding.

### The Beginning

My journey began with the **CS50 Introduction to Computer Science** course. It was during this course that I discovered my interest in web programming.

### The Dive into Frontend

From there, I immersed myself in the essentials:
- **HTML**
- **CSS**
- **SCSS**
- **Bootstrap**
- **JavaScript**
- **React**

### Exploring the Backend

After mastering frontend development, I ventured into the backend:
- **PHP**
- **Laravel**
- **Livewire**
- **Alpine.js**
- **Firbase**
- **Tailwind CSS**

### Finding My Passion

Throughout my journey, I found a special interest in **JavaScript** and **React**. These technologies have become my core strengths and my favorite tools to work with.
